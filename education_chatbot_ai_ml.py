-------------------------------------------------
- Meets requirement: answers 15 predefined questions correctly.
- Bonus: handles small phrasing variations via fuzzy matching & aliases.
- Tech stack: Python 3.x + (optional) Streamlit for UI. CLI mode also included.

Run (UI):
  pip install streamlit
  streamlit run education_chatbot_ai_ml.py

Run (CLI):
  python education_chatbot_ai_ml.py --cli
